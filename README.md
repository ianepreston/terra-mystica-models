# Terra Mystica Models

Predict outcomes of terra mystica games

## Setup
For Mac/*NIX systems the only external requirement for this project is ```conda```. If you don't have it already you can install it [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Grab the Python 3.7 version for your operating system. For Windows it's a bit more complicated [this guide](https://ianepreston.github.io/2020/02/15/windows-ds-software.html) will help you get set up.

Once that's done from this a terminal in this folder run the following commands to download the data and produce the analysis:

```bash
# Set up the conda environment with dependencies and the terra_mystica_models package
make create_environment
# everything else needs to be run from within that environment
conda activate terra_mystica_models
# Download the data, transform it, fit a model, and run some game scenarios
make analysis
```
