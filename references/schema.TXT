Summary information of all finished games, grouped by month the
game finished. The files are refreshed and a new file added on
the 1st of the month.

The data is in JSON, with the following schema:

- toplevel - list of games
  - game - Id of game (does not appear to need to be unique)
  - last_update - Timestamp for when the game finished
  - player_count - number of players in the game (at start)
  - factions - list of players / factions
    - player - username of player
    - faction - faction the player is using

    The leaves of this subtree will have the general format of
    having a "round" field, under which you have round fields from
    0-6 (how many times this thing happened on that round) and an
    "all" field (how many times it happened in the game total). For
    example, faction.witches.dig.round.5 == 3 means that the
    witches generated 3 spades from converting workers on round 5.
